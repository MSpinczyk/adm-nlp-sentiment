* w twitter140.ipynb jest preprocessing

* sentiment (2).ipynb - trening + parameter search - NIE ŚCIĄGAJ, JESTEŚ NA CONTIRBUTORZE NA KAGGLU, TAM JUZ JEST DATASET ITD.

* wyniki całkiem git - linear regression ~79% i lstm 80%
* tu jest mocny notebook 87% https://www.kaggle.com/code/heyytanay/sentiment-clf-jax-flax-on-tpus-w-b

Each report should include:
1. A short description of the solved problem with a figure demonstrating it (about 0.5 of an A4 page).
2. Reference to the source of the data.
3. Description of the method used to solve the problem (about 0.5 of an A4 page).
What loss function was used?
4. Details on how the method was used to solve the problem (about 1 to 2 A4 pages).
5. Results (at least one A4 page).
6. Discussion (about 0.5 of an A4 page).
Here you should briefly indicate the most important results and which parts of the project were the most challenging.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
For grade 3.0 you need to provide a basic solution for the selected task.

Projects for grade 4.0 and above need to use an automatic tuner for hyperparameter selection, for example [Hyperband](https://keras.io/api/keras_tuner/tuners/hyperband/), [Bayesian optimization](https://keras.io/api/keras_tuner/tuners/bayesian/) or [random search](https://keras.io/api/keras_tuner/tuners/random/).

For grade 5.0 you need to compare at least two substantially different approaches to solve the problem (for example two different classes of neural network architectures).
Describe in your report what did you do to get a fair comparison. For some ideas you can refer to [nnU-Net: Self-adapting Framework for U-Net-Based Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10486).

Incorrect implementation of a project may result in a lower grade depending on the severity of the issue.
Low performance of the best selected model alone will not negatively affect the grade, although it may indicate an issue with the code which may cause the grade to be lower.

Project implementations may be presented in class. Grades of groups that presented will be increased by 0.5, up to the maximum of 5.0.
